# log4cpp-2015
A fork of log4cpp, compilable in Visual Studio 2015.

The latest oficial log4cpp source code available at [sourceforge.net](http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net/) at the time of writing (1.1.2 RC5) doesn't build on **Visual Studio 2015 Update 3**. As previous patches submitted there (e.g., for [Visual Studio 2013](https://sourceforge.net/p/log4cpp/patches/40/)) seem to be ignored, I decided to make this fork.
